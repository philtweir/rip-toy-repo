# Toy repo to reverse in place

Please note, this was written offline with the local Rust docs,
so it is not expected to be in any way sensible or idiomatic,
and I haven't gone and checked how it should be done yet -
just practicing a fun puzzle.

(thanks to @sigma for the mem::swap and split_at_mut tips!)
